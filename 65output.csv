D6655,Spam,0.77,"Sensitive data request with unsubscribe link and authentication failures (DKIM failed). Bulk mailing pattern with high domain similarity score suggests spam rather than targeted attack."
D6656,No Action,0.62,"Meeting request with high urgency keywords but all authentication passed (SPF/DKIM/DMARC). Despite VIP similarity concern, strong authentication and low risk scores suggest legitimate email."
D6657,Malicious,0.93,"Extremely high exfiltration behavior score (0.98) - highest in dataset. DMARC failure with high infrastructure risk scores. Critical data exfiltration threat."
D6658,No Action,0.59,"Authentication passed (SPF/DMARC passed) with low risk scores across multiple categories. Limited suspicious indicators suggest legitimate email traffic."
