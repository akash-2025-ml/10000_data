## Emails Requiring Reclassification

### 1. D5399 - Should be "Warning" not "No Action"
**Current Classification:** No Action (0.65)
**Recommended Classification:** Warning
**Reason:** This is a bank detail update request which is inherently high-risk. Even though sender_maliciousness is low (0.16), the request type alone warrants caution. Bank detail update requests should never be classified as "No Action" due to the potential for financial fraud.

### 2. D5414 - Should be "Spam" not "No Action"
**Current Classification:** No Action (0.55)
**Recommended Classification:** Spam
**Reason:** Has a spam score of 0.47 (moderately high) and marketing characteristics. While not dangerous, it should be filtered as spam rather than allowed through with "No Action".

### 3. D5419 - Should be "No Action" not "Malicious"
**Current Classification:** Malicious (0.85)
**Recommended Classification:** No Action
**Reason:** Very low sender_maliciousness (0.03), passed SPF, valid certificate, and has token validation success. The classification overreacted to the invoice verification request type despite clear indicators of legitimacy.

### 4. D5431 - Correctly classified but note the severity
**Current Classification:** Malicious (0.91)
**Justification is correct:** Sender spoof detected (value = 1) confirms impersonation attack. This is appropriately classified as Malicious.

### 5. D5420 - Correctly classified
**Current Classification:** Malicious (0.96)
**Justification is correct:** Wire transfer request with sender_maliciousness of 0.88 and high AMSI suspicion (0.78). Multiple authentication failures confirm this as a clear financial fraud attempt.

### 6. D5418 - Correctly classified
**Current Classification:** Malicious (0.85)
**Justification is correct:** Wire transfer request with high sender_maliciousness (0.66) and maximum exfiltration behavior (0.99). Classic BEC attack.

### 7. D5391 - Correctly classified
**Current Classification:** Malicious (0.85)
**Justification is correct:** Gift card request with failed SPF, expired SSL certificate. Classic BEC pattern.

### 8. D5412 - Correctly classified
**Current Classification:** Malicious (0.84)
**Justification is correct:** Gift card request with very high sender_maliciousness (0.82), contains macros, and SPF failure.

### 9. D5400 - Should be "Malicious" not "Spam"
**Current Classification:** Spam (0.88)
**Recommended Classification:** Malicious
**Reason:** Invoice verification request with spam score of 0.87, but more importantly has SPF and DMARC failures. The combination of financial request + authentication failures suggests a malicious attempt rather than simple spam.

### 10. D5428 - Should be "Spam" not "No Action"
**Current Classification:** No Action (0.60)
**Recommended Classification:** Spam
**Reason:** While sender_maliciousness is low (0.08), it's a document download request with 2 domains detected and failed SPF. The classification missed potential risk indicators.

## Summary of Misclassifications

**Total Emails Reviewed:** 50
**Misclassifications Found:** 5
- 3 under-classifications (should be more severe)
- 2 over-classifications (should be less severe)

### Key Patterns Observed:
1. **Financial requests (bank updates, wire transfers, gift cards) with any authentication failures should always be at least Warning, preferably Malicious**
2. **Spam scores above 0.4 should result in Spam classification, not No Action**
3. **Low sender_maliciousness with successful authentication and token validation indicates legitimacy, even for sensitive request types**
4. **Sender spoof detection (value = 1) should always result in Malicious classification**
5. **Multiple authentication failures (SPF + DKIM + DMARC) are strong indicators of malicious intent**

### Recommendations:
1. Implement stricter rules for financial request types
2. Lower the threshold for spam classification
3. Weight authentication failures more heavily in the scoring
4. Consider request type as a primary factor, not just a contributing factor
5. Review the confidence scoring to ensure it reflects the severity appropriately
