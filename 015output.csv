Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D4133,Malicious,0.85,Email exhibits multiple high-risk indicators including moderate sender reputation issues (0.52), high AMSI suspicion score (0.85), presence of macros (0.59), executable attachment behavior with high sandbox score (0.54), and exploit pattern detected. The email failed SPF/DKIM/DMARC authentication checks and shows suspicious metadata scores. These combined signals strongly suggest malware delivery attempt.
D4134,Malicious,0.92,Critical malicious indicators present with extremely high sender reputation risk (0.97), packer detected in attachment indicating obfuscation, presence of macros (0.70), VB/JS scripts (0.33), ActiveX objects (0.84), high sandbox execution time suggesting evasion tactics, failed authentication (SPF fail), and wire transfer request type. Pattern consistent with advanced malware or ransomware delivery.
D4135,Warning,0.65,Email shows mixed signals with low sender risk but invoice verification request type, failed SPF/DKIM checks, presence of embedded files, and domain reputation issues. While not overtly malicious, the authentication failures combined with financial request warrant caution and verification before proceeding.
