Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D5483,Warning,0.78,Email contains concerning indicators: domain_known_malicious=1 (confirmed bad domain), sender_name_similarity_to_vip=0.41 (moderate VIP impersonation), very low sender reputation (0.0001), DKIM=fail but SPF=pass. While the domain is flagged as malicious and there's VIP impersonation, the request_type=none and lack of active malicious content suggest reconnaissance rather than active attack.
D5484,Warning,0.83,Email contains concerning signals: request_type=legal_threat (social engineering), SPF=softfail, SSL=self-signed, high content_spam_score=0.46, and moderate behavioral scores. Legal threats combined with authentication issues and self-signed certificates warrant warning classification, though lacks definitive malicious payloads.
D5485,Warning,0.75,Email shows mixed risk indicators: any_macro_enabled_document=1 (macro present), request_type=link_click, SSL=expired, max_behavioral_sandbox_score=0.39 (moderate threat), but SPF=pass and low sender reputation. Macro-enabled document with expired SSL suggests potential threat but authentication passes.
D5486,Warning,0.78,Email exhibits warning signs: request_type=bank_detail_update (high-risk financial request), SPF=softfail, DKIM=fail, DMARC=fail (complete authentication failure), SSL=self-signed. Bank detail updates with total authentication failure strongly suggest phishing attempt.
