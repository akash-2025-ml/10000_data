Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D4383,Warning,0.72,Email exhibits moderately suspicious characteristics with YARA rule matches (3), suspicious string entropy (7), and relatively high exfiltration behavior score (0.41). The sender has low reputation (0.0003) and multiple security failures (SPF fail, no DMARC). However, absence of malicious attachments and known malicious domains prevents higher risk classification.
D4384,Malicious,0.89,High-risk email with sender marked as known malicious (0.79), spoofed domain detected, and high likelihood of temporary email (0.63). Critical security failures across SPF, DKIM, and DMARC with malicious SSL certificate. The high macro presence (0.70), VBScript detection (0.90), and ActiveX objects (0.62) strongly indicate malware delivery attempt.
D4385,Warning,0.68,Contains legal threat request type with moderately concerning signals including suspicious metadata (0.57), VBScript detection (0.69), and DMARC enforcement. Multiple URLs (4) present with valid SSL but moderate behavioral score (0.20) suggests potential social engineering attempt requiring user caution.
D4386,Spam,0.75,Bulk marketing email with high temporary email likelihood (0.94), link click request, and image-only content. High presence of macros (0.82) and VBScript (0.94) but low actual threat scores. SPF failure and lack of proper authentication indicate typical spam campaign characteristics.
D4387,Warning,0.64,Bank detail update request with moderate risk indicators including high VBScript presence (0.78), expired SSL certificate, and SPF failure. However, low sender maliciousness score (0.01) and absence of malicious attachments suggest potential phishing attempt rather than direct malware delivery.
D4388,Warning,0.71,VPN/MFA reset request with concerning behavioral patterns including high metadata suspicion (0.60), exfiltration behavior (0.63), and VBScript detection (0.66). Valid SSL and proper TLS but SPF/DKIM failures indicate sophisticated social engineering targeting authentication credentials.
D4389,No Action,0.58,Legitimate email with no specific request type, valid SSL certificate, and proper TLS encryption. Despite some VBScript presence (0.48) and SPF failure, the absence of malicious indicators, attachments, and suspicious URLs indicates benign communication.
D4390,Warning,0.73,Legal threat email with embedded file, high exfiltration score (0.69), and spam characteristics (0.79). Multiple authentication failures (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) and behavioral sandbox concerns (0.095) suggest social engineering attempt exploiting urgency.
