Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D4933,Malicious,0.95,High sender maliciousness score (0.90) with request type indicating legal threat. Multiple suspicious signals including VBScript/JavaScript detected (0.90), urgency keywords present, and failed SPF/DKIM authentication. The combination of legal threats with technical indicators strongly suggests a phishing attempt using social engineering tactics.
D4934,Warning,0.75,Moderate risk profile with temporary email likelihood (0.68) and multiple suspicious attachment indicators. Max suspicious string entropy score suggests potential obfuscation. Failed authentication checks (SPF/DKIM) and presence of embedded files warrant caution but lack strong malicious indicators to classify as fully malicious.
D4935,Warning,0.70,High sender maliciousness score (0.80) but no specific malicious request type detected. Failed all authentication checks (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) and shows content spam characteristics. The valid SSL certificate and lack of attachment-based threats reduce severity but authentication failures maintain warning status.
D4936,Malicious,0.88,Invoice verification request with high presence of macros (0.94) and scripts (0.84). Failed DMARC check and self-signed SSL certificate indicate spoofing. DMARC enforced but failed suggests active impersonation attempt. Pattern matches invoice fraud with technical indicators confirming malicious intent.
D4937,Warning,0.80,Moderate sender reputation issues with high script presence (0.85) and ActiveX objects (0.70). Domain shows high exfiltration behavior score (0.87) suggesting data harvesting. Failed DKIM but passed DMARC. Lacks specific malicious request type for full malicious classification.
D4938,Malicious,0.90,Very high sender maliciousness score (0.84) with multiple red flags including failed SPF/DKIM/DMARC, certificate mismatch on destination URLs, and moderate URL rendering behavior score. No specific request type but technical indicators strongly suggest malicious intent with potential credential harvesting setup.
D4939,No Action,0.85,Low sender maliciousness score (0.09) with passing SPF and DMARC checks. Meeting request type appears legitimate with valid SSL certificates. High presence of macros is concerning but in context of legitimate business communication with proper authentication, likely represents normal document sharing.
D4940,Malicious,0.85,Moderate to high sender maliciousness score (0.63) with meeting request and DMARC enforced.
