D5333,Warning,0.75,This email shows concerning indicators including moderate sender maliciousness (0.40), presence of macros (0.73), VBScript/JavaScript detected (0.67), ActiveX objects (0.67), and invoice verification request type. Combined with SPF softfail and DKIM/DMARC failures, this appears to be a suspicious invoice-related email that warrants caution but lacks definitive malicious attachments or IOCs.
D5334,Warning,0.80,The email exhibits multiple warning signs including moderate sender maliciousness (0.53), presence of executable patterns with high sandbox execution time (152.9s), VBScript detection (0.03), ActiveX presence (0.91), and high exfiltration behavior score (0.93). The presence of 1 IOC and behavioral issues suggest potential data harvesting attempts, though no malicious attachments were confirmed.
D5335,Malicious,0.85,This email demonstrates clear malicious indicators with high behavioral sandbox score (0.70), substantial metadata suspicious score (0.31), presence of macros (0.55), VBScript (0.61), and ActiveX objects (0.90) along with high exfiltration behavior score (0.72). Multiple suspicious embedded files (4) and valid SSL certificate with high URL reputation risk (0.41) indicate a sophisticated attack vector.
D5336,Malicious,0.95,Extremely high sender maliciousness (0.96), temporary email likelihood (0.43), wire transfer request, presence of macros (0.58), VBScript (0.76), and ActiveX (0.91). Self-signed SSL certificate and DMARC temperror failure create a perfect storm of malicious indicators. This is clearly a Business Email Compromise (BEC) attempting fraudulent wire transfers.
D5337,Malicious,0.90,Very high sender maliciousness (0.90), enforced DMARC but still failed authentication, presence of macros (0.73), scripts (0.47), and ActiveX (0.72). The sender domain reputation is poor (0.32) with SPF/DMARC failures. This appears to be a sophisticated phishing attempt bypassing some security measures.
D5338,Malicious,0.90,High sender maliciousness (0.68), poor domain reputation (0.35), presence of scripts and ActiveX objects. Critical finding: 5 malicious components detected, self-signed SSL certificate, and domain known malicious. Multiple confirmed malicious indicators make this a clear threat requiring immediate blocking.
D5339,Spam,0.85,Moderate sender maliciousness (0.56), gift card request type with poor reply path reputation, marketing keywords detected. SPF passes but contains scripts and ActiveX objects. This appears to be a spam campaign potentially escalating to gift card scams, fitting the spam classification with social engineering elements.
D5340,Spam,0.80,Contains gift card request with moderate maliciousness indicators, user previously marked similar emails as spam, presence of macros and scripts. Multiple URLs (3) detected with concerning reputation. This is characteristic of recurring spam campaigns targeting gift card fraud.
D5341,Malicious,0.85,Critical wire transfer fraud attempt with 5 YARA rule matches indicating known malware patterns, SPF authentication failure, and outdated TLS 1.0 encryption. Wire transfer requests combined with multiple technical red flags and authentication failures constitute a clear financial fraud attempt requiring immediate blocking.
D5342,Warning,0.70,Document download request with multiple embedded files (4), concerning script presence, and infrastructure issues (SPF fail, TLS 1.1). The combination of technical indicators and social engineering suggests a potential malware delivery attempt requiring caution.
D5343,No Action,0.65,Low sender maliciousness (0.03), legitimate-looking email with SPF/DKIM/DMARC failures but no malicious content detected. No executable attachments or concerning behavioral patterns. Authentication failures appear to be configuration issues rather than malicious intent.
D5344,Malicious,0.85,Very high sender maliciousness (0.86), sensitive data request targeting high-risk role, poor domain reputation (0.95), and complete authentication failures. This appears to be a targeted spear-phishing attack attempting to harvest sensitive organizational data.
D5345,Malicious,0.90,High sender maliciousness (0.63), extreme temporary email likelihood (0.93), meeting request with suspicious behavioral patterns including high AMSI score (0.67), scripts, and ActiveX objects. Self-signed SSL certificate and authentication failures indicate sophisticated phishing.
D5346,Warning,0.80,High temporary email likelihood (0.71), presence of macros, scripts, and high exfiltration score (0.85). Self-signed SSL certificate but passing authentication. Appears to be a suspicious email that could escalate to data theft.
D5347,Warning,0.75,High sender maliciousness (0.82), moderate domain reputation issues, presence of scripts and ActiveX objects. No specific malicious content but concerning sender reputation warrants careful handling of any requests.
D5348,Malicious,0.85,High sender maliciousness (0.73), legal threat request type with extreme metadata suspicious score (0.92), behavioral issues, and presence of macros and scripts. Legal threats are common pressure tactics in phishing and this shows multiple red flags.
D5349,Warning,0.70,Link click request with packer detected, moderate script presence, and mixed authentication results. Previous spam history and bulk indicators suggest recurring spam campaign with potential for malicious escalation.
D5350,No Action,0.60,Low sender maliciousness (0.08), bank detail update request but with relatively clean technical indicators. While the request type is concerning, the lack of malicious attachments and passing authentication suggests a potentially legitimate communication.
D5351,Malicious,0.95,Extremely high sender maliciousness (0.85), VPN/MFA reset request with malicious attachment detected, high behavioral sandbox score (0.79), and expired SSL certificate. This is a critical security threat attempting to compromise authentication systems.
D5352,Warning,0.75,Moderate sender maliciousness (0.52), high spam content score (0.86), multiple URLs detected. While passing some authentication checks, the combination of spam indicators and link presence suggests phishing preparation.
D5353,Warning,0.70,Legal threat with moderate maliciousness, some script presence, and authentication failures. Legal threats are pressure tactics but lower technical threat indicators suggest warning-level concern.
D5354,Warning,0.80,Link click request with return path known malicious, temporary email likelihood (0.18), and suspicious behavioral patterns. The combination of social engineering and technical indicators warrants careful scrutiny.
D5355,Warning,0.70,Bank detail update request with moderate sender reputation issues, SMTP IP known malicious, and expired SSL certificate. While not overtly malicious, the infrastructure issues and sensitive request type require verification.
D5356,Warning,0.75,VPN/MFA reset request with moderate maliciousness, suspicious metadata score (0.27), and self-signed SSL certificate. Authentication attempts with concerning request type suggest potential account takeover preparation.
D5357,Malicious,0.85,High sender maliciousness (0.79), bank detail update request with SMTP issues and SSL certificate mismatch. Failed authentication and sensitive financial request create high risk for financial fraud.

D5359,Warning,0.75,Despite low sender maliciousness (0.18), this email has 3 YARA rule matches indicating suspicious patterns, extremely high SMTP IP maliciousness (0.92), and 7 embedded files. The combination of behavioral detections and infrastructure issues warrants careful examination before any action.
D5360,Warning,0.70,Moderate maliciousness with suspicious metadata, multiple embedded files (6), and self-signed SSL certificate. Mixed authentication results and infrastructure issues suggest compromised or suspicious sender.
D5361,Warning,0.65,Legal threat with moderate sender maliciousness (0.29), mixed authentication, and some concerning patterns. Legal pressure tactic but lower technical threat level.
D5362,Warning,0.70,Although sender maliciousness is low (0.07), the extremely high AMSI suspicion score (0.93) indicates potential script-based threats or obfuscated behavior. With 2 domain URLs present and suspicious metadata (0.28), this requires careful review as AMSI detections are rarely false positives.
D5363,No Action,0.60,Moderate sender maliciousness (0.42) but clean attachment analysis, passing authentication, and minimal suspicious content. Appears to be legitimate email with some reputation issues.
D5364,Warning,0.70,Invoice verification with moderate maliciousness, self-signed SSL certificate, and authentication failures. Common phishing vector but moderate threat indicators suggest warning level.
