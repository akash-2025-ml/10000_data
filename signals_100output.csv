Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
W001,Warning,0.75,Moderate sender maliciousness (0.45), invoice verification request with multiple warning signals including 2 YARA matches, presence of macros and VBScript, failed authentication (SPF softfail, DKIM/DMARC fail), and suspicious behavioral patterns. While concerning, lacks definitive malicious attachments or high-severity indicators.
W002,Warning,0.80,Multiple concerning indicators including moderate sender maliciousness (0.50), document download request, 1 IOC detected, failed authentication with expired SSL certificate, and presence of VBScript/ActiveX objects. High exfiltration behavior score (0.35) and moderate behavioral patterns warrant caution but insufficient for malicious classification.
W003,Warning,0.70,Packer detected with moderate sender maliciousness (0.40), link click request, 3 YARA matches, presence of VBScript/ActiveX objects, self-signed SSL certificate, and URL shortener usage. Combined technical indicators suggest potential threat requiring careful scrutiny.
W004,Warning,0.85,Wire transfer request with moderate to high sender maliciousness (0.55), 2 YARA matches, presence of macros/VBScript, failed authentication across all protocols, and moderate behavioral scores. Financial request type combined with technical red flags creates elevated risk requiring investigation.
