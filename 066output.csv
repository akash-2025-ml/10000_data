D6683,Warning,0.72,"Bank detail update request with authentication issues (DKIM policy, DMARC none) and self-signed certificate. Low risk scores but suspicious request type requires monitoring."
D6684,Malicious,0.83,"VPN/MFA reset request with high temp email likelihood (0.0004), authentication failures (SPF/DKIM failed), and final URL known malicious (1). Expired certificate increases risk profile."
D6685,Warning,0.74,"Wire transfer request with very high temp email likelihood (0.84) but exfiltration score (0.55) below malicious threshold. Authentication failures (SPF failed, DMARC failed) require monitoring."
