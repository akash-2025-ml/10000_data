Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D5433,Malicious,0.95,Email shows critical malicious indicators: any_file_hash_malicious=1 (known malware detected), max_exfiltration_behavior_score=0.61 (high data exfiltration risk), request_type=wire_transfer (financial request), SPF=softfail and DMARC=fail (authentication failures), urgency_keywords_present=0.96 (high urgency). The combination of known malware with wire transfer request and failed authentication strongly indicates a malicious phishing/malware campaign.
D5434,Warning,0.80,Email contains several concerning signals: any_vbscript_javascript_detected=1 (active script present), request_type=document_download, self-signed SSL certificate, but SPF=pass and sender reputation is low but not malicious (0.0025). The JavaScript presence with document download request raises security concerns, but legitimate authentication suggests possible compromised legitimate account or risky content.
D5435,Spam,0.85,Email shows spam characteristics: sender_temp_email_likelihood=0.45 (moderate temporary email probability), no specific request type, low sender reputation (0.0008), content_spam_score=0.39 (moderate spam score). No malicious attachments or urgent requests detected. SPF=pass but DKIM=policy suggests bulk sending patterns typical of spam campaigns.
D5436,Spam,0.75,Email exhibits spam indicators: content_spam_score=0.56 (high spam likelihood), marketing patterns suggested by low sender reputation (0.25), request_type=sensitive_data_request but no malicious attachments or scripts. DMARC=temperror and site_visual_similarity_to_known_brand=0.73 suggests possible brand impersonation attempt, but lack of malicious payloads indicates spam rather than targeted attack.
D5437,No Action,0.70,Email appears legitimate despite some minor concerns: request_type=meeting_request (common business request), all authentication passes (SPF=pass), no malicious files detected, low spam score (0.00009). Some embedded files present (total_embedded_file_count=3) but behavioral scores are low. Legitimate business communication with standard security profile.
D5438,Warning,0.85,Email shows warning-level threats: max_metadata_suspicious_score=0.59 and max_amsi_suspicion_score=0.55 (suspicious file metadata), max_exfiltration_behavior_score=0.94 (very high exfiltration risk), but DMARC=pass and no request type specified. The high behavioral threat scores with passed authentication suggest potentially compromised legitimate sender or advanced threat.
D5439,Spam,0.80,Email displays spam characteristics: very high sender reputation (0.95) paradoxically with high marketing keywords (html_text_ratio=0.0 suggests image-only content), sender_name_similarity_to_vip=0.92 (impersonating VIP), no malicious files but site_visual_similarity_to_known_brand=0.64. Classic spam impersonation tactics without malicious payload.
D5440,Warning,0.75,Email contains warning signals: unscannable_attachment_present=1 (encrypted/corrupted file), request_type=legal_threat (social engineering), sender reputation very low (0.003), DKIM=policy failure. Legal threat with unscannable attachment is concerning but lack of known malicious indicators prevents malicious classification.
D5441,Warning,0.80,Email shows mixed threat signals: request_type=link_click with high bulk_message_indicator=1, SPF=pass but DMARC=fail, max_behavioral_sandbox_score=0.11 (moderate sandbox threat), self-signed SSL certificate. Bulk phishing attempt with moderate technical threats warrants warning classification.
D5442,Warning,0.70,Email has concerning elements: request_type=bank_detail_update (high-risk request), marketing_keywords_detected=0.43, but all authentication passes (SPF=pass) and no malicious files detected. Bank detail update requests are inherently risky but legitimate authentication and lack of malicious indicators suggest warning level.
D5443,Malicious,0.90,Email shows strong malicious indicators: reply_path_known_malicious=1 (malicious reply address), unique_parent_process_names includes powershell.exe (suspicious execution), request_type=vpn_or_mfa_reset (credential theft attempt), max_metadata_suspicious_score=0.46. Combination of malicious infrastructure with credential theft attempt indicates targeted attack.
D5444,Malicious,0.92,Email exhibits critical malicious signals: final_url_known_malicious=1 (leads to known malicious site), request_type=wire_transfer (financial fraud), max_exfiltration_behavior_score=0.67 (high data theft risk), url_reputation_score=0.73 (poor URL reputation).
